# Array Assignment CS260 

In this assignment, you will make a *wrapper* class around a List. 
This class will add functionality and attributes to an Object in order to have it mimic the behavior of an array.

---

## Set Up
You will need to clone this repository in order to begin working on this assignment

This repository is a *scaffold* of the Array class. The structure has been defined, but you will need to fill in the functionality. 

Currently all functions you need to write are going to throw a `NotImplementedError`. You must overwrite this error with functionality.

---

## Tests
There is a set of unit tests that will run. You can use these to troubleshoot your Array implementation.

The test suite will run whenever you `git push` your code to the remote repository. If you go to the **Actions** tab on your GitHub repository for the assignment, the most recent commit message will be at the top. While on the Actions tab, click the most recent commit message and then click on **autograding** once redirected. Expanding on "**Run education/autograding@v1**" will drop down a test log which will give you more information on which tests passed/failed.

You can also run the tests locally by installing the python pytest package and then running `pytest` in a terminal window. This should be identical to what is run on GitHub.
